    ☐ POST /editnotification
        This should send an email with a token
        ☐ Add controller
            ☐ sendEditNotificationEmail
                ✔ Should receive email @done(18-11-08 00:52)
                ✔ Should generate a new token @done(18-11-08 00:52)
                    ☐ Figure out how to add the token to the db
                        Needs two fields: token and createdAt or expiresAt
                        Can be added to the current collection or a new one
                        Figure out if mongo has some feature to autodelete a document based on a timestamp.
                        This would make it easier to delete an unused and invalid token.

                ☐ Should respond with 200/400
☐ Move messages and db code errors to constants
☐ Create interface for notificationObj
☐ Consider sending the welcome email in the background and allow the process to continue
    Since this email is just for saying welcome and basic information, it's not critical if the user
    doesn't receive it ?
☐ Test Joi validation errors
    I may need to do some custom validation messages if Joi's arent that great
☐ Allow multiple currencies
☐ Create interface for email variables
    variables: any
